# CodeGarden18
I thought it would be interesting to pull together a list of people from social media who are going to CodeGarden this year. My plan would then be to try and meet each one and tick them off the list. 

Just a bit of fun really. Please add your name below and I'll hopefully meet you in a couple of weeks time.
